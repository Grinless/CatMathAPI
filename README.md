# CatMathAPI

A Math Library created for learning purposes.
Likely to change, or be optimised as I continue to work on it.  
## Current Implementation ---------
1. Point2D struct. 
2. Point3D struct.
3. 3. Rough 2D Vector Struct. 
4. Rough 3D Vector Class.
5. Rough 2D Matrix class.
6. Rough 3D Matrix class.


## Planned Features ---------
1. Splines. 
2. Quaternions.
3. Statistics (Probability, Fuzzy Logic Classes).
4. Interpolation. 
5. Easing functions. 
6. Collision prediction.
